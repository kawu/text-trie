# Text-trie: Patricia trie for Text keys

This library provides a simple implementation of patricia tries over [http://hackage.haskell.org/package/text](textual) keys
with polymorphic value type.  It is loosely based on [http://hackage.haskell.org/package/bytestring-trie](bytestring-trie)
library which works with bytetrings keys.
